# 4BIT_RIPPLECOUNTER
# AIM: 
To simulate and synthesis  4bit ripple counter using vivado. 
# APPARATUS REQUIRED: 
vivado 2023.2 software. 
# PROCEDURE: 
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project. 
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the 
Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish 
button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the 
Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and 
verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.
